# POS-System

Hello!

I am Ervon Rey Mellisa, I'm currently working on this POS system for a future project that I might sell or use. The current
motivation I have to make this system is just because I am bored and I want to explore more about what Java has in store for me.
As of now, I am currently trying to document the project and focus on the flowchart first and then focus on the front-end of the code.
After that is done,  I will then focus on the back-end and include the Database structure that I will think of in the future while
maintaining the documents so that if I ever want to sell this Program I can have something to paste in their database using the SQL Workbench app.

Also I will be scanning almost every product there is so that I will have an idea about the products to be scanned. However, I will also
add an option where the admin or the cashier can add their own items or products just in-case if there is a product that has been not registered.
